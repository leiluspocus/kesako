Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kesako? is a new kind of audioguide for museums and other expositions. The purpose of the project is to scan QR Code and to link each QR Code to a painting, a photography, or more generally an artwork. 

Functionnalities
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With this application, a user can :
- scan a QRCode to get more informations about an artwork
- see the last 5 scanned artworks

If I have time, I will develop these extra functionnalities :
- Audio description of the artwork (that can be trigerred by the user)
- Rating system (the user will be able to rate the artwork) 
- Translation in several languages

Methods
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is QR Code ?
QRCode is the trademark for a type of barcode which consists of black pixels arranged in a square pattern on a white background. The advantages of using QRCode are :
- open-source technology
- free to use
- fast to read 

Where are the informations about the artworks ?
The informations about the artworks will be stored in an XML file, which will be read at the launch of the application. The organisation of the XML File would be the following: 
<artwork>
  <qrcode>URL Generated by the QRCode</qrcode>
	<title>Title of the artwork</title>
	<desc>Description of the artwork</desc>
</artwork> 
We will also show a picture of the artwork. In order to have a lighter XML File, we can read the media files (photo, audio description) using the url generated by the qrcode.
